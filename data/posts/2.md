## The Evolution of CSS

CSS has evolved tremendously over the years. Modern CSS offers powerful features that make creating complex layouts easier than ever before.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that gives you precise control over your page layout. It's perfect for creating complex, responsive designs with minimal code.

## Flexbox

Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts. It makes aligning items, distributing space, and creating flexible components much simpler.

## CSS Variables

CSS variables (custom properties) allow you to store values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. This makes your CSS more maintainable and easier to theme.

By mastering these modern techniques, you'll be able to create beautiful, responsive websites with cleaner and more maintainable code.
