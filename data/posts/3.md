## Writing Quality JavaScript

JavaScript is a powerful language, but it's important to follow best practices to write code that's maintainable, efficient, and bug-free.

## Key Best Practices

- **Use meaningful variable names** - Your code should be self-documenting
- **Keep functions small and focused** - Each function should do one thing well
- **Avoid global variables** - Use modules and closures to encapsulate your code
- **Handle errors properly** - Always anticipate and handle potential errors
- **Comment your code** - Explain the why, not just the what

## Modern JavaScript Features

Take advantage of ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators, and async/await. These features make your code more concise and readable.

Remember, writing good code is a skill that improves with practice and experience.
