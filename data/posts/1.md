## Introduction to Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're looking to build your first website or advance your career, understanding the basics is crucial.

## Essential Technologies

To get started with web development, you'll need to learn three core technologies:

- **HTML** - The structure of web pages
- **CSS** - The styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - The interactivity and logic

## Your First Steps

Start by creating simple HTML pages, then add CSS for styling. Once you're comfortable with these, dive into JavaScript to make your pages interactive. Practice regularly and build projects to solidify your understanding.

Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Take your time, be patient with yourself, and enjoy the learning process!
