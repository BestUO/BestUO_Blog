## What is Responsive Design?

Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures your website looks and works well on all devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

## Mobile-First Approach

Start designing for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance for larger screens. This ensures your website works well on the smallest screens and takes advantage of larger displays when available.

## Key Techniques

- **Flexible grids** - Use relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels
- **Flexible images** - Make images scale with their containers
- **Media queries** - Apply different styles based on device characteristics

## Testing Your Design

Always test your responsive designs on real devices. Emulators are helpful, but nothing beats testing on actual hardware.

With responsive design, you can create one website that provides an optimal experience for all users, regardless of their device.
